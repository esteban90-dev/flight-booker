# Flight-Booker

This is an app that allows a user to search for flights, choose one, then book it.  Once a flight is successfully booked, the user is prompted to book another.  

This app was built to practice using nested forms.  To provide the user with flights to search for, 1000 flights were generated randomly between 10 different airports on a random date.  The 'duration' of each flight was estimated based on the [Haversine](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/haversine) distance between the two airports, and an average flight speed of 500 mph.  

The app was styled using Twitter Bootstrap. 

This was the [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Advanced Forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms) project.
